This is to request the CSV or database file listing the properties with delinquent taxes for a specific tax year.

Dear Cook County Treasurer FOIA officer, 

I am requesting a copy of the annual tax sale records for 2019 tax year (payable in 2020) in a tabular file format. Specifically, I am seeking a CSV file of the data used to produce the PDFs of tables that are publicly available on the Treasurer's website that list the following attributes: PIN, property address, taxpayer name, current mailing address, volume, tax type, tax year, total tax due, total due, township, municipality, classification, senior, senior freeze, veteran, longtime homeowners, and prior tax years may also be unpaid. 

Website where the lists are publicly available: https://www.cookcountytreasurer.com/delinquenttaxes.aspx

I am requesting that any fees associated with this request be waived as this request is in the public interest. It is well-documented that properties with delinquent taxes remain on the list for years with no resolution, and that the only people who bid on these properties are those with the resources to assemble the lists into actionable information. By sharing the list more broadly, and by mapping it, more people, including local residents and entrepreneurs, will gain the ability to participate in the delinquent tax sale process. 

Thank you for your help.
