A FOIA request to obtain the results of a recent Scavenger Sale.

````
Dear Cook County Treasurer FOIA officer,

I am requesting a spreadsheet (in CSV or XLS format) that lists the properties that were offered for sale in the 2022 Scavenger Sale and their outcomes. 

The spreadsheet should contain these fields, at a minimum: PIN, address, taxpayer name, property class, outstanding taxes and interest and fees, the status (including whether there was a no cash bid, offered not sold, or sold), the bid amount, any overbid amount, and the name of the bidder. 

Thank you for your help.

-[your name]
