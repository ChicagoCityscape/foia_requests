FOIA request to obtain a list of PINs in Cook County.

````
Dear Cook County Treasurer FOIA officer,

Pursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request the following records:

A list of the 14-digit PINs that were active in the 2021 property tax year, preferably in a spreadsheet form like XLS, XLSX, or CSV. 

I think that fees should be waived. Publishing a list of properties, identified by their PIN, in the 2021 property tax year is in the public interest because it enables the public to have more insight and transparency around the Cook County property taxing processes which were largely opaque until the Chicago Tribune investigation in 2017 that identified multiple issues. Additionally, your office waived my last request, in 2021, for the PINs active in the 2020 property tax year. 

This list is the basic starting point to any analysis because it shows which properties are active in that and can be analyzed for their tax revenue contributions and compared to previous years.

The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.

In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.

Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Sincerely,

[your name]
